## Description | <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/20/undefined/book.png"/>

The social API mimicks a back-end of a typical social app by serving Users and user's Thoughts. Being a fictional app backend API this code is meant to demonstrate ability to work with NoSQL database. In this particular example CRUD operations can be performed on MongoDB in order to work with the database by creating, reading, updating, deleting users, their thoughts, and "reactions" to the posted thoughts.
